The Quad-Switch-and-Mult-O-Matic is based on the Roland System 100 M173 module.
Instead of passive mults, this module has active mults.
The mults are normalized in groups of 2. IA is normalized to IB and IC is normalized to ID.
The trigger inputs of the switches are normalized, so the rising edge GT-input of I1 is normalized to the rising edge GT-input of I2, IN3 and IN4. In a similar fashion the falling edge GT-input of I1 is normalized to the rising edge GT-input of I2, IN3 and IN4. So you can control all switches with one rising GT or one falling GT or control them all individually.
